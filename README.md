- Hi, I am AYUB QAMAR
- I’m interested in immunogenetics and immune response of Hepatitis-B patients.
- I’m currently working on the Humen Leukocyte antigen, Complement system, and telomere length and their association with Hepatitis-B recovery in Pakistani and Chinese populations.
- I am keenly interested in the immuno-informatics, viral Bioinformatics and their association with respect to disease outcomes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on both wet and dry analysis on the Hepatitis-B disease immune response and immunoinformatics of Hepatitis-B.
